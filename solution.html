The solution is to either define the missing class in your `tailwind.config.js` or to remove the class reference. If the class was a typo, correct the spelling.
```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-xl font-bold">
</div>
```
To explicitly define `text-xl` and `font-bold`, you can add them to your `tailwind.config.js` file under the `theme` section.  However, in most cases this is unnecessary as these are standard Tailwind classes.

Check for typos and ensure that all classes are correctly spelled and defined within your Tailwind configuration.
