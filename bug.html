This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  For example:
```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 @apply text-xl font-bold">
</div>
```
If the class `text-xl` or `font-bold` is not defined in your Tailwind CSS configuration, it will result in the class being ignored, causing the unexpected styling.
